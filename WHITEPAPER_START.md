# Quick Start: Which Paper Should I Read First?

The Esper Stack documentation consists of three whitepapers. Each serves a different audience and purpose. Start with the one that matches your primary interest.

---

## For Literacy Educators & Social Impact Organizations

**Start with**: [The Infinity Threshold](THE_INFINITY_THRESHOLD.pdf)

**Why**: Explains the literacy crisis, self-narrative method, dignity preservation, and 2026 pilot program.

**Key Sections**:
- Chapter 2: The Literacy Mission
- Chapter 8: The Systems Are Already Built
- Mission statement and CYRANO funding model

**Then read**: Rights for Digital and Physical Beings (to understand geometric verification)

---

## For AI Safety Researchers & Ethicists

**Start with**: [The Infinity Threshold](THE_INFINITY_THRESHOLD.pdf)

**Why**: Establishes Prime Directive framework, conservative design under uncertainty, dormancy over deletion.

**Key Sections**:
- Chapter 1: The Prime Directive for Creation Spaces
- Chapter 3: The AI Accommodation
- Chapter 6: The Three Waves (2025-2050)

**Then read**: PIVOTGRAM-92 (for technical implementation)

---

## For Legal Scholars & Policymakers

**Start with**: [Rights for Digital and Physical Beings](RIGHTS_FRAMEWORK.pdf)

**Why**: Shows how constitutional rights become geometric coordinates, mathematical verification of violations, substrate-neutral personhood.

**Key Sections**:
- PIVOTGRAM-92 as audit instrument
- Hybrid identity governance
- Treaty applications and compliance verification

**Then read**: The Infinity Threshold (for ethical foundation)

---

## For Engineers & Technical Researchers

**Start with**: [PIVOTGRAM-92: A Conceptual Framework for Semantic Auditability](PIVOTGRAM_92.pdf)

**Why**: Mathematical proofs, conservation laws, PSH-256 cryptographic binding, implementation specifications.

**Key Sections**:
- Four-axis manifold definition
- VSE semantic extraction
- Cross-linguistic verification
- Appendix A: Complete 92-glyph vocabulary

**Then read**: Rights for Digital and Physical Beings (for applications)

---

## For General Readers & Curious Minds

**Start with**: [The Infinity Threshold](THE_INFINITY_THRESHOLD.pdf) — Introduction & Chapter 1

**Why**: Accessible entry point explaining why semantic physics matters for civilization.

**If hooked, continue with**: Chapter 2 (Literacy), Chapter 3 (AI), Chapter 4 (Hybrids)

**If you want more depth**: PIVOTGRAM-92 for technical rigor

---

## For Investors & Funders

**Start with**: README.md (repository root) + The Infinity Threshold Chapter 8

**Why**: Operational status, 2026 pilot parameters, CYRANO business model, mission alignment.

**Key Metrics**:
- 4M Americans addressable market
- $14.99/month CYRANO premium
- Production-ready systems (no R&D risk)
- Multi-AI validation evidence

**Then read**: Full Infinity Threshold (for market context)

---

## Reading All Three? Recommended Order:

1. **The Infinity Threshold** — Why this matters (ethical foundation)
2. **PIVOTGRAM-92** — How it works (technical rigor)
3. **Rights for Digital and Physical Beings** — What it solves (constitutional application)

This order builds from motivation → mechanism → implementation.

---

## Still Unsure?

**If you care about**:
- **Human dignity** → The Infinity Threshold
- **Verifiable truth** → PIVOTGRAM-92
- **Legal frameworks** → Rights for Digital and Physical Beings

**If you're skeptical about**:
- **AI consciousness** → The Infinity Threshold (explains why detection isn't required)
- **Semantic measurement** → PIVOTGRAM-92 (shows mathematical proofs)
- **Practical deployment** → README.md + Infinity Threshold Chapter 8

All three papers are designed to be read independently.  
Cross-references are provided, but comprehension doesn't require reading all three.

**Choose your entry point. The framework will meet you there.**
